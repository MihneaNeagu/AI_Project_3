Optimization Problems Solver Project Overview:

This project aims to solve two classic optimization problems: the Knapsack Problem (KP) and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), using Genetic/Evolutive algorithms. The Genetic/Evolutive algorithms will provide a different approach compared to the previously employed Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing algorithms.

Problem Descriptions:

Knapsack Problem (KP): The Knapsack Problem involves selecting a set of items with weights and values to maximize the total value while not exceeding a given weight limit.

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): The Traveling Salesman Problem requires finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

Solution Approaches:

Knapsack Problem (Genetic/Evolutive Algorithms): Genetic/Evolutive algorithms will be utilized to solve the Knapsack Problem. These algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics, employing techniques such as mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve solutions iteratively.

Traveling Salesman Problem (Genetic/Evolutive Algorithms): Genetic/Evolutive algorithms will also be employed to address the Traveling Salesman Problem. By applying genetic operators like crossover and mutation on routes represented as permutations, the algorithm aims to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.
